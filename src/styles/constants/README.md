# Edits to Style Constants

Changes to style constants are heavily discouraged. Please ask whether your change is truly necessary, or if you could use tokens from another design system instead.

If a constant must be added or changed:
* Manually update variables.js, variables.json, and variables.ts. See previous commits in this directory for examples.
* Example: https://github.com/box/box-ui-elements/pull/3068/files
* A review from the box-ui-elements team is required
