`import ContextMenu from 'box-ui-elements/es/components/context-menu/ContextMenu';`

The `<ContextMenu>` component requires a target component and a `<Menu>` component to be passed in as the only children.
It handles positioning the menu attached to the target on right click and global document click closing.
