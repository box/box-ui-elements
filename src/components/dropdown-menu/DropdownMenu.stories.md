The `<DropdownMenu>` component requires a "button" component and a `<Menu>` component to be passed in as the only children.
It handles keyboard navigation, focus states, and global document click closing. This component is compliant with the
[WAI-ARIA Menu Buttons standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#menubutton).
