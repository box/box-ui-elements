`import NotificationsWrapper from 'box-ui-elements/es/components/notification/NotificationsWrapper';`

`NotificationsWrapper` is a `Portal`ed div that acts as a container to hold the notifications. This component has no logic of its ownâ€”it should be used to implement your own application-specific logic for creating new notifications.

For example, an application can use Redux to implement notifications:

- Notifications are stored in the Redux store
- To add a new notification, dispatch an action
- The reducer would create a new notification and add that to its store
- To remove a notification, dispatch an action
