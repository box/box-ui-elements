## Positioning System

### Box UI Elements (TetherComponent)

- Positioning Props:
  - attachment: 'top left' | 'top right' | etc.
  - targetAttachment: 'bottom left' | 'bottom right' | etc.
  - constraints: Array of positioning rules
    ```javascript
    constraints: [
      {
        to: 'scrollParent' | 'window',
        attachment: 'together',
        pin: boolean,
      },
    ];
    ```
  - Manual positioning calculation
  - Complex constraint system
  - Less intuitive positioning configuration

### Blueprint (Radix UI Positioning)

- Positioning Props:

  - side: 'top' | 'right' | 'bottom' | 'left'
  - align: 'start' | 'center' | 'end'
  - avoidCollisions: boolean
  - collisionPadding: number | Padding
  - sticky: 'partial' | 'always'
  - sideOffset: number
  - alignOffset: number

- Benefits:
  - More semantic positioning system
  - Automatic collision detection
  - Better viewport containment
  - Simpler configuration
  - Built-in animations
  - Improved performance
  - Better handling of dynamic content

### Migration Considerations

- TetherComponent to Radix UI transition:
  - Different positioning terminology
  - Simpler constraint system
  - More predictable behavior
  - Better performance characteristics
  - Improved accessibility integration

  - Manual ARIA attribute management
  - Basic WAI-ARIA menu button compliance
  - Custom keyboard navigation implementation
  - Manual focus management

- Blueprint/Radix UI:
  - Built-in WAI-ARIA menu button compliance
  - Comprehensive ARIA attribute handling
  - Enhanced keyboard navigation
  - Automatic focus management
  - Better screen reader support

### Keyboard Navigation

- Box UI Elements:

  - Space/Enter: Toggle menu
  - Arrow Right: Open menu
  - Arrow Down: Open menu and focus first item
  - Arrow Up: Open menu and focus last item
  - Escape: Close menu
  - Manual focus trap implementation

- Blueprint:
  - Space/Enter: Open menu and focus first item
  - Arrow Down: Open menu and focus first item
  - Arrow Up: Open menu and focus last item
  - Arrow Right: Open submenu
  - Arrow Left: Close submenu
  - Escape: Close menu
  - Home: Focus first item
  - End: Focus last item
  - Type character: Move to matching item
  - Automatic focus trap management

### Focus Management

- Box UI Elements:

  - Manual focus management through refs
  - Custom focus trap implementation
  - Manual focus restoration
  - Document click handlers for blur

- Blueprint:
  - Automatic focus management through Radix UI
  - Built-in focus trap
  - Automatic focus restoration
  - Better handling of nested focus contexts
  - Improved focus restoration on menu close

## Core Props Mapping

### Box UI Elements Props -> Blueprint Equivalent

1. bodyElement (HTMLElement) -> container (HTMLElement)

   - Maps to DropdownMenuPortal's container prop
   - Both control where menu content is rendered
   - Blueprint provides more flexible portal handling

2. children (React.Node) -> Split across components

   - First child -> DropdownMenuTrigger children
   - Second child -> DropdownMenuContent children
   - Blueprint requires explicit component structure
   - Improves component composition and reusability

3. constrainToScrollParent (boolean) -> collisionBoundary (Boundary)

   - Maps to DropdownMenuContent's collisionBoundary
   - Different approach to scroll parent containment
   - Blueprint offers more granular collision control

4. constrainToWindow (boolean) -> avoidCollisions (boolean)

   - Maps to DropdownMenuContent's avoidCollisions
   - Blueprint handles collision avoidance automatically
   - More robust positioning system through Radix UI

5. constrainToWindowWithPin (boolean) -> sticky (boolean)

   - Maps to DropdownMenuContent's sticky prop
   - Controls whether menu stays within viewport
   - Blueprint provides better viewport containment

6. isResponsive (boolean) -> No direct equivalent

   - Blueprint handles responsive behavior automatically
   - Uses modern CSS features for responsiveness
   - Consider using CSS media queries instead

7. isRightAligned (boolean) -> align="end" (string)

   - Maps to DropdownMenuContent's align prop
   - Blueprint offers more alignment options
   - More semantic alignment system

8. onMenuClose (function) -> onOpenChange (function)

   - Maps to DropdownMenuRoot's onOpenChange
   - Blueprint uses single handler for open/close
   - Provides event object with more context

9. onMenuOpen (function) -> onOpenChange (function)

   - Maps to DropdownMenuRoot's onOpenChange
   - Blueprint consolidates state management
   - More consistent event handling

10. tetherAttachment (string) -> side, align (string)

    - Maps to DropdownMenuContent's positioning props
    - Blueprint uses more semantic positioning system
    - More intuitive and flexible positioning options

11. tetherTargetAttachment (string) -> side, align (string)

    - Maps to DropdownMenuContent's positioning props
    - Blueprint simplifies positioning configuration
    - Better defaults and automatic positioning

12. useBubble (boolean) -> modal (boolean)
    - Maps to DropdownMenuRoot's modal prop
    - Controls event propagation behavior
    - Blueprint provides better event isolation

- Box UI Elements: Single DropdownMenu component

  - Combines trigger and menu content in a single component
  - Uses TetherComponent for positioning
  - Manages its own state and focus handling
  - Requires exactly two children: button and menu
  - Handles keyboard navigation and accessibility internally
  - Manages document click handlers for menu closing

- Blueprint: Composable components based on Radix UI primitives
  - DropdownMenuRoot: Controls overall state and behavior
    - Manages open/close state
