<!--
Please add the `ready-to-merge` label when you have received both approvals
Using the `ready-to-merge` label adds your approved pull request to the merge queue and when master is in a green state from a previous merge.
Mergify will merge your PR based on the queue assuming your pull request is still in the green state after the previous merge

In case the `ready-to-merge` label not working?
1. Do you have two approvals?
   2. We have a requirement to require two approvals in order to merge to master.
2. Did you remove the unnecessary reviewers?
   3. e.g. three reviewers were added but you already have two necessary approvals. Remove the other reviewer or have them approve the pull request.
3. Is there any other pull requests in the merge queue before?
   4. Mergify handles the queueing, your pull request will eventually get merged.

When to contact someone for assistance when trying to merge via `ready-to-merge` label?
1. There are no other pull requests in the merge queue and your pull request has been sitting there with the `ready-to-merge` label for longer than a couple of hours.
2. If you are unable to remove unnecessary reviewers from the pull request.
3. If you are unable to add the `ready-to-merge` label.
