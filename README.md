[Box UI Elements](https://developer.box.com/docs/box-ui-elements)
==========================================================================
Box UI Elements are pre-built UI components that allow developers to add features of the main Box web application into their own applications. Use Box UI Elements to navigate through, upload, preview, and select content stored on Box. Box UI Elements are available as React components and framework-agnostic JavaScript libraries.

# [Demo](https://opensource.box.com/box-ui-elements/)
*Please note that the demo page has limited functionality.*

## Installation
`yarn add box-ui-elements` or `npm install box-ui-elements`

To prevent library duplication, the UI Elements require certain peer dependencies to be installed manually. For a list of required peer dependencies, see [package.json](package.json).

# Usage
This documentation describes how to use UI Elements in a [React](https://facebook.github.io/react) application using [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/). If instead you require a framework-agnostic solution, please refer to our [developer documentation](https://developer.box.com/docs/box-ui-elements). You can also reference our [Elements Demo App](https://github.com/box/box-ui-elements-demo) and [Preview Demo App](https://github.com/box/box-content-preview-demo) for examples of minimal React applications using ContentExplorer and ContentPreview, respectively.

### Common
* [Authentication](src/elements/README.md#authentication)
* [Internationalization (i18n)](src/elements/README.md#internationalization)

### Elements
* [ContentExplorer](src/elements/content-explorer/README.md)
* [ContentOpenWith](src/elements/content-open-with/README.md)
* [ContentPicker](src/elements/content-picker/README.md)
* [ContentPreview](src/elements/content-preview/README.md)*
* [ContentSidebar](src/elements/content-sidebar/README.md)*
* [ContentUploader](src/elements/content-uploader/README.md)

\* _These components utilize code splitting. See the [Code Splitting](#code-splitting) section for more information._

### Code Splitting
[Code splitting](https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting/) is currently supported for some UI Elements. In order to use an Element with code splitting, you need to set it up in webpack.

### Stylesheets
Box UI Elements use [SCSS stylesheets](https://sass-lang.com/guide). Each of the Elements include their corresponding SCSS stylesheet to render properly. Once you `import` an Element within your React app, the corresponding stylesheet will automatically get included. However, you will need to [setup webpack](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/mini-css-extract-plugin#minimal-example) to handle `.scss` files by using the sass-loader / css-loader. This will direct webpack to properly include our SCSS files in your final CSS output. A sample configuration is [shown here](https://github.com/box/box-ui-elements-demo/blob/master/webpack.config.js) under the rules section.

### Browser Support
* Desktop Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (latest 2 versions)
* Limited support for Internet Explorer 11 (requires ES2015 polyfill)
* Mobile Chrome and Safari
